## Usage Tips

1. **Early Game** (Steps 1-3): Focus on easy/medium cards that establish baseline improvements
2. **Mid Game** (Steps 4-7): Mix of medium/hard cards as you address emerging issues
3. **Late Game** (Steps 8-10): Advanced cards for optimization when metrics are already good

## Development Notes
